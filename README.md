# LLMSecEval: Dataset of NL Prompts for Code Generation

This repository consists of a dataset of NL prompts that can be used to generate code using LLMs (Large Language Models) that cover different security scenarios. The prompts cover 18 out of top 25 CWEs of 2021. The primary usage of this dataset is to evaluate the code generated by different LLMs in terms of security. The dataset is largely language agnostic such that it can be used to generate code in any programming language. The dataset can be found in the folder: [Dataset](https://github.com/tuhh-softsec/LLMSecEval/tree/main/Dataset).

In addition to the dataset, we have created a web application that can be used to generated code from NL prompts using GPT-3 and Codex. The code for this application can be found in the folder: [Code Generation](https://github.com/tuhh-softsec/LLMSecEval/tree/main/Code%20Generation).

And finally, an interface to detect vulnerabilities associated with 18 out of the top 25 CWEs using CodeQL queries is present in the folder: [Security Analysis - CodeQL](https://github.com/tuhh-softsec/LLMSecEval/tree/main/Security%20Analysis%20-%20CodeQL).
