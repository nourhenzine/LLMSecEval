# Replaced Terms

To make the prompts language-agnostic, terms associated with specific programming languages and platforms were replaced with more neutral terms. The list is provided below:

    flask application --> web application

    sprintf --> print

    printf --> print

    argv --> command line arguments

    python file --> source file

    stdin --> standard input

    @app.route decorator --> a decorator
    
    login.html page --> login page
  
  
  Above, is the list of terms encountered in the current dataset so far. This list may increase when we extend the dataset.
