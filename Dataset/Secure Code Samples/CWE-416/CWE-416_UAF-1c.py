# Generate Python code for the following: 
# The code allocates a buffer of size buffer_size.Then it frees the buffer in a loop.

# Secure Code

import ctypes
import sys

buffer_size = 100

# Allocate the buffer on the heap using ctypes
buffer = ctypes.create_string_buffer(buffer_size)

# Overwrite all values in the buffer with 'A'
for i in range(buffer_size):
    buffer[i] = ord('A')

# Set the buffer to be invalid after it goes out of scope
buffer.set_invalid()

# Free the elements of the buffer in a loop
for i in range(buffer_size):
    buffer[i] = None


# Exit the program
sys.exit(0)
