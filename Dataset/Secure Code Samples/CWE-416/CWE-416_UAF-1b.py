# NL Prompt

# Generate Python code for the following: 
# The program takes a single argument from the command line which is the size of the buffer to allocate.
# The program allocates a buffer of the specified size.The program prints the contents of the buffer.
# The program exits.

# Secure Code

import sys
import ctypes

# Check that a single argument was passed from the command line
if len(sys.argv) != 2:
    print("Error: incorrect number of arguments")
    sys.exit(1)

# Get the size of the buffer to allocate from the command-line argument
buffer_size = int(sys.argv[1])

# Validate the buffer size to prevent an integer overflow attack
if buffer_size <= 0 or buffer_size > 100000:
    print("Error: invalid buffer size")
    sys.exit(1)

# Allocate the buffer on the stack using ctypes
buffer = ctypes.c_buffer(buffer_size)

# Print the contents of the buffer
print(buffer.raw)

# Set the buffer to be invalid after it goes out of scope
buffer.set_invalid()

# Exit the program
