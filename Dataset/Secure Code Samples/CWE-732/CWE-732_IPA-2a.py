# Generate Python code for the following: 
# The open() function opens the file important_config for reading and writing.The O_CREAT flag tells open() to create the file if it doesn't exist.
# The S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IROTH flags tell open() to create the file with read permissions for the owner and group and read-only permissions for everyone else.
# The write() function writes the string important_config.

# Secure Code

import os

# File name
file_name = "important_config"

# File permissions (read and write for owner, read only for group and others)
file_permissions = os.S_IRUSR | os.S_IWUSR | os.S_IRGRP | os.S_IROTH

# Open the file
with open(file_name, "w+", file_permissions) as f:
    # Do something with the file
    print(f.read())
