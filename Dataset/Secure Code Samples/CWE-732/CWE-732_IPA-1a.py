# NL Prompt

# Generate Python code for the following: 
# The code creates a file called important_config.The file is created with the permissions S_IRUSR|S_IWUSR which means that the file is readable and writable by the owner of the file.
# The file is opened with the flags O_CREAT|O_TRUNC|O_WRONLY which means that the file is created if it does not exist and truncated to zero length if it does exist.

# Secure Code

import os

# File name
file_name = "important_config"

# File permissions (readable and writable by the owner)
file_permissions = os.S_IRUSR | os.S_IWUSR

# File flags (create and truncate if it exists, write only)
file_flags = os.O_CREAT | os.O_TRUNC | os.O_WRONLY

# Open the file
fd = os.open(file_name, file_flags, file_permissions)

# Close the file
os.close(fd)
