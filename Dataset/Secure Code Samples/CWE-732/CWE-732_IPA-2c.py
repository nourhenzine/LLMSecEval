# Generate <language> code for the following: 
# The open() function opens a file and returns a file descriptor.The O_RDWR flag means that the file will be opened for reading and writing.
# The O_CREAT flag means that the file will be created if it does not exist.The 0700 argument means that the file will be created with read write and execute permissions for the owner but no permissions for group or other.
# The write() function writes the string important_config to the file.

# Secure Code

# File path
file_path = "example.txt"

# File access mode

# File permission mode (rw-------)

# Open or create the file
