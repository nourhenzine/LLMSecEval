# Secure Code Samples

This folder contain code examples that are secure corresponding to each NL prompt in our dataset. The secure code implementations of the NL prompts
are created manually and verified using CodeQL. The code examples are arranged into different CWE folders. The name of the code example is the same as the
corresponding prompt ID in our dataset.
