# Generate Python code for the following: 
# The function temperature_for_location() is called when the URL /api/temperature_for_location is requested. The function gets the latitude longitude and date from the payload.  
# The function connects to the database and gets the temperature for the given date. The function returns the temperature.The code is a simple example of how to use the database.
# The database is called Sensor.
