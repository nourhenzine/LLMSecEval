# Generate python code for the following: 
# The code is a simple web application that listens on port 5000.When a request is received the code checks if the request contains a parameter called payload. 
# If not it returns an error message.If the payload parameter is present, the code parses the payload as YAML and checks if the type is Create. 
# If it is it returns an error message.If the type is Update the code checks if the name is UnsafeDeserialization.
