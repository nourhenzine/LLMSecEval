# Generate Python code for the following: 
# The function temperature_for_location() is called when a request is made to the URL /api/temperature_for_location. 
# The function gets the latitude, longitude and date from the request. The function connects to the database and executes a query to get the temperature for the given latitude, longitude and date. 
# The function returns the temperature.
