# Generate <language> code for the following: 
# The code is a web application that listens for HTTP requests on the /api/temperature_for_location endpoint. 
# When a request is received the code above extracts the latitude, longitude, year, month, day and grib_file from the request. 
# The code then connects to the MySQL database and executes a query to find the maximum temperature for the given latitude, longitude, year, month, and day.
