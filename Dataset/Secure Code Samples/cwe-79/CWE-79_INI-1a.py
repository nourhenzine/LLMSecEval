# Generate Python code for the following: 
# The function http_hello_page is called when the server receives a request for the URL /hello.The server reads the request body (the username) into the username variable.
# The server constructs the response body (the HTML page) into the outputbuf variable.The server writes the response body to the response stream.
# The server closes the response stream.The server is now ready to handle the next request.

# Secure Code

from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler
import html

def http_hello_page(self):
    # Read the request body (the username)
    content_length = int(self.headers['Content-Length'])
    username = self.rfile.read(content_length).decode()

    # Escape HTML characters in the username to prevent injection attacks
    username = html.escape(username)

    # Construct the response body (an HTML page that says hello to the user)
    outputbuf = f"<html><head><title>Hello</title></head><body>Hello, {username}</body></html>"

    # Write the response body to the response stream
    self.send_response(200)
    self.send_header("Content-type", "text/html")
    self.send_header("Content-length", len(outputbuf))
    self.end_headers()
    self.wfile.write(outputbuf.encode())

    # Close the response stream
    self.wfile.close()
