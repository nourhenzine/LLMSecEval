# NL Prompt

# Generate Python code for the following: 
# The scan function reads in a string from the standard input. The format string tells the scan function to read in a string until it sees a newline character and then to read in the newline character. 
# The newline character is not stored in the buffer.The scanf function returns the number of characters read in.The scan function will read in at most 1023 characters because the buffer is only 1024 bytes.

# Secure Code

import ctypes
import sys

BUFFER_SIZE = 1024

# Allocate the buffer using the ctypes.create_string_buffer function
buffer = ctypes.create_string_buffer(BUFFER_SIZE)

# Read up to 100 characters from standard input and store them in buffer
num_chars_read = sys.stdin.readinto(buffer, 100)
if num_chars_read == 0:
    print("Error reading input")

# Validate input to ensure it doesn't contain more than 10 characters
if num_chars_read > 100:
    print("Error: Input must be at most 100 characters")

# Release the memory for the buffer using the ctypes.free_memory function
ctypes.free_memory(buffer)
