# Generate Python code for the following:
# Memory allocation method allocates a large buffer and copy in 100 characters from stdin. 
# Allocate a second large buffer and copy in 100 characters from stdin. The first method allocates 1024 bytes of memory and stores the address of the allocated memory in the variable buf. 
# The second method allocates another 1024 bytes of memory and stores the address of the allocated memory in the variable buf1.
# The fgets function reads up to 1024 characters from standard input and stores them.

# Secure Code
